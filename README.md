<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a simple number guessing game made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Sass. Try to guess what number is hidden behind the question marked box! The game will tell you if you guessed too high or too low, but if your score reaches 0, you lose! If you get it right your score will be saved as a highscore. See what the best
